# A Splunk App to Visualize Your Search Data as Network Graph   

Splunk is a software platform to search, analyze and visualize the machine-generated data gathered. It makes machine data accessible, usable and valuable to everyone.  

A Splunk app is an extension of Splunk functionality which has its own in-built UI context to serve a specific need. Effectively, it is a web application with predefined set of UI components to visualize the search result.

Splunk UI supports react, which makes it a useful extention for developer to add more UI components for specialized visualization requirements.  Information extracted from Splunk presented as network graph will help network enginer/security analyst to get more insight from it.

This project implemented a Splunk App with network visualization.  It allows developer to create customized UI component to present your search result a network graph.
